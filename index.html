    <h1>The Journey</h1>
</header>
<body>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Creating something from nothing takes a lot of time and effort. It is a process of trial and error that can only be executed <br>
        if you give yourself time to both try and fail. Failure is a part of the learning experience, there is almost nothing you do <br>
        that reliably accomplished the first time with no issues and spinning up a full stack app is no different.
    </p>
    <h2>What you Lack</h2>
    <p>
        When I began my journey as a developer, I struggled with basic functions like building a class and keeping a solid naming scheme. <br>
        Everybody starts from nothing. However, one issue that kept coming back to bite me (and still does) is keeping myself on task and <br>
        focusing on one issue until it is done. What helps me in this area is the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-handoffs">Agile handoff.</a>. <br>
        <br>
	    The agile handoff is, in a nutshell, the deliberate process of receiving and submitting your code each time you complete a task. <br>
        It includes creating a new <a href="https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/best-branching-strategies-high-velocity-development">branch of code</a> for each task, documenting the work you have done, and closing the issue when it\â€™s done. <br>
        It allows a clean, task-oriented way of building an app that ensures deliberate actions and helps you stay focused on one thing at a time.
    </p>
    <h2>What you Learn</h2>
    <p>
        Agile development is a structure that allows for decisive actions that hone in on specific problems and inherently keeps track of the<br>
        progress on specific issues. The Agile handoff helped me immensely. When I stay on track and focused, my work is not only faster, but<br>
        it allows me to build code with progress in mind and avoid the dreaded <a href="https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/">scope creep</a>. The journey to becoming a developer is a long and<br> 
        arduous one, but in the end it comes down to focus. So, in the end, just remember to sign off. <br>
