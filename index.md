## Introduction

Creating something from nothing takes a lot of time and effort. It is a process of trial and error that can only be executed  
if you give yourself time to both try and fail. Failure is a part of the learning experience; there is almost nothing you do  
that reliably accomplishes the first time with no issues, and spinning up a full stack app is no different.

## What You Lack

When I began my journey as a developer, I struggled with basic functions like building a class and keeping a solid naming scheme.  
Everybody starts from nothing. However, one issue that kept coming back to bite me (and still does) is keeping myself on task and  
focusing on one issue until it is done. What helps me in this area is the [Agile handoff](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-handoffs).

The agile handoff is, in a nutshell, the deliberate process of receiving and submitting your code each time you complete a task.  
It includes creating a new [branch of code](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/best-branching-strategies-high-velocity-development)  
for each task, documenting the work you have done, and closing the issue when itâ€™s done.  
It allows a clean, task-oriented way of building an app that ensures deliberate actions and helps you stay focused on one thing at a time.

## What You Learn

Agile development is a structure that allows for decisive actions that hone in on specific problems and inherently keeps track of the  
progress on specific issues. The Agile handoff helped me immensely. When I stay on track and focused, my work is not only faster, but  
it allows me to build code with progress in mind and avoid the dreaded [scope creep](https://www.wrike.com/project-management-guide/faq/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/).  
The journey to becoming a developer is a long and arduous one, but in the end it comes down to focus. So, in the end, just remember to sign off.
